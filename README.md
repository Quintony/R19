Building
---
Download [WolvenKit](https://github.com/WolvenKit/WolvenKit), preferrably
[nightly](https://github.com/WolvenKit/WolvenKit-nightly-releases).

Afterwards, run
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nullfrctl/R19.git
```
Then, open `R3 2019.cpmodproj` in WolvenKit. Pack and Install.

Installation
---
Download from the [releases](https://github.com/nullfrctl/R19/releases) tab or 
simply download [`R3 2019.zip`](https://github.com/nullfrctl/R19/raw/master/R3%202019.zip) 
from the repository. I will assume that you know how to install Cyberpunk 2077
mods.

Alternatively, [build](#Building) the project in WolvenKit to ensure you have the
most up-to-date version of R19
